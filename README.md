# Modeling and PID Controller Design of the Ball on Wheel problem

The notebook [ball_on_wheel.ipynb](ball_on_wheel.ipynb) presents the final project for the undergraduate course "Control I" from the Mechatronics Engineering degree course at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo. 

For this project the "Ball on Wheel" problem was tackled, which is shown in the figure bellow.
Given a set of ODEs describing the dynamics of the system, these were transformed into the frequency domain and a PID controller was designed using the Root Locus method, Bode and Nyquist diagrams.
Additionally, an introductory overview and an extensive analysis of the obtained results are provided.<br>
